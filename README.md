# PruebaTeoricaCosevi
Created in a couple of days in order to help a friend to bring his app into a native system to be able to use the Huawei SDK.

Pending Work:
 * Fix Commit History with more declarative information.
 * Refactor on components, create sharedComponents if something get's repeated (Everything were created so quickly that i didn't care to much at the moment).
 * Implement logic for UI with logos.
 * Split helper. code into utils.js modules.
